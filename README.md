# react-file-upload-manager

This is a POC of how you would implement an upload manager with react.
Please note that this hasn't been tested. So don't use it in production.

## Install 

This has not been published to npm, yet, but this is how it would work:

    npm install react-file-upload-manager

Take a look at [example.js](./example.js)!
    

## Development

First install

    npm install

Run the dev servers:

    npm run dev

And open: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your preferred browser.
